This page collects information about the founder's project in the Entrepreneurial Cybersecurity Course of Study at Saarland University.

The key facts in brief:

* In the Founder's Project, you follow and realize a business idea in the area of cybersecurity and computer science, with the intent of creating a business at the end of the project.
* You work as a team of 2-4 students over a total of three semesters.
* During this time, you create and evolve a _prototypical implementation_ and a _business proposal_.
* At the end of each semester, a _Jury_ of scientists and business experts examines your progress and decides whether you can continue the project in the next semester.

## Latest Updates

* 2021-01-20 Added requirement for contact info
* 2021-01-07 Detailed the Very Initial Proposal, added VCs
* 2020-12-09 Initial version


## Your Team

Your team should consist of 2-4 students. Your team will need to encompass several qualities, both from an organizational and technical perspective. Hence, diversity is key. As a single person, you are less likely to realize all these qualities in a single individual, so you are well advised to team up with others.

Your team members should plan to finish their studies at the same time. Over time, your project will need more and more devotion from you, so try to minimize interference with studies. At the end of the project, all of you should be ready to create a business without having a conflict with getting your degree first.

Your team members should come from Entrepreneurial Cybersecurity, ideally in the same cohort as you. A good way to find additional team members is the lecture series "Perspectives on Cybersecurity", which is mandatory for all students of Entrepreneurial Cybersecurity.


## Your Idea

Getting a good idea is hard. Your idea must be good enough to eventually sustain you and your business economically - and hopefully go beyond mere sustaining :-) Hence, you need to think about _unique selling points_:

* What is the unique property that sets you apart from the crowd? 
* And how is it that you can make money from? 

These two questions will follow you throughout the project.

A great source for ideas is the lecture series "Perspectives on Cybersecurity", which specifically focuses on open and promising issues, as well as examples from successful founders.

Another great source is your _lecturers_. Ask them for specific challenges, opportunities, or open questions in their field –&nbsp;often, researchers have some technology recently developed which one may make money from, but the researchers themselves focus on academic goals.

If you develop your idea all alone, you own the rights to it. If you adopt the idea from another researcher, they or they employer may own its rights. Consult early within your team as with potentially involved third parties as it comes to intellectual property.


## Starting the Founder's Project

Starting the Founder's Project is similar to a thesis –&nbsp;you need to find a _topic_ (that is, your idea), a _team_, and an _academic advisor_ (called a mentor).

Your mentor, however, will only devote time on teams whose ideas have reached some initial level of maturity –&nbsp;that is, they are not dismissed with the first argument.

### Your Idea

To refine your ideas, the course spokespersons (Andreas Zeller and Bernd Finkbeiner) offer appointments in which you can present initial ideas (however immature they may be) and get feedback.

### The Very Initial Proposal

To express your idea, you have to draft a _Very Initial Proposal_. This is a two-page document consisting of two parts:

* One page that briefly describes
	* your idea
	* your team – including, for each team member:
		* Name, First name • Student ID • Email address • Phone number
		* 2-3 sentences on background and role in the project
	* the market and competition
* One page that shows your idea from a customer's perspective (= a mock-up web site, a mock-up leaflet)

This Very Initial Proposal will be first be approved by one of the course spokespersons. Their feedback may lead you to go back to the drawing board, likely in several rounds. 

### The Mentor

Once the Very Initial Proposal is approved, the spokespersons will help you finding a mentor. (You can also use it to search for a mentor yourself). Once you are accepted by a mentor, the project will officially start.


## Your Prototype

During the project semesters, you will systematically develop your idea, both from a _technological_ as well as from a _business_ standpoint; your mentor will assist you with that. This typically means to _implement_ a prototype that demonstrates the feasibility and value of your idea. This prototype may well become the base of your later business, so make sure it is developed to high standards from the very beginning.

As students, you own the rights to all your work in the prototype. The university may claim usage rights for scientific purposes. Using third-party code may require specific arrangements.


## The Jury Sessions

At the end of each semester, there is a _Jury session_ in which a Jury of scientists and business experts will evaluate your progress. 

A typical Jury session format is as follows:

* 15 minutes meeting of the jury (without you)
* 15 minutes pitch
* 15-45 minutes Q&A by jury
* 15 minutes deliberation of the jury (without you)

Both the pitch and the Q&A session are deliberately short –&nbsp;focus on the essentials. A typical pitch shows

1. the _problem_ and _market_ you are addressing,
2. what is _new_ and _promising_ about your idea,
3. why you are the _ones who can do it_, 
4. that your _prototypical solution_ may work, and
5. that your _business proposal_ is sound.

The Jury members will be provided with handouts of your presentation as well as your business proposal (see below). The Q&A session will focus on the pitch and the proposal.

This Jury session is crucial for your passing the respective project semester; if the Jury is not convinced, you will not pass.


## Your Business Proposal

To make the Jury meeting efficient, you have to provide a _business proposal_ that details your idea. Together with the prototype, this proposal documents your achievements in the respective semester of the founder's project.

Your proposal should be organized along a number of questions (which actually are typical for evaluating business proposals). With each semester, you will have to answer more questions and to provide more details; your business proposal will thus grow in time.

CISPA and Saarland University provide counseling on business ideas. They will be happy to provide feedback on your proposals, especially at the late stages.

While the full list of questions may feel intimidating at first, keep in mind that at the beginning, you only need few answers –&nbsp;and these can still be vague. Only at the end of the third semester do things get serious, and that is when you should have all answers ready for potential investors.

## Starting your Business

At a later stage during the founder's project, you may actually be founding your company. This is again where the project teams at CISPA and Saarland University can help you. They will also be happy to get you in contact with investors, both nationally, and internationally; and also help with getting more team members into your company.


## Your Thesis

In the last semester of the project, you will also write your _Master's Thesis_. Your thesis would typically be rooted in your joint project, and document and evaluate an individual technical aspect of your solution. Your thesis thus can also serve as reference for current and future co-workers in your company.

Each team member writes her/his thesis individually; this is thus an opportunity for each team member to highlight her/his individual contributions. As the thesis requirements are more lightweight than in other CS courses of study, you can still focus on your joint project.


## And Then...

After your thesis is done and your founder's project is completed with the third semester, you will have 

* your _degree_, 
* a _prototype_, 
* a well-polished _business plan_ –&nbsp;
* and if you're lucky, you may even have an _investor_ at hand (say, from one of the Jury sessions).

At this point at the latest, your studies are over. Congratulations! However, CISPA and Saarland University will be more than happy to talk to you about further funding of your business and your entrepreneurial career. See you!
