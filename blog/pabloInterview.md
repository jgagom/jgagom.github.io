## Pablo Valle interviewed by the Kitto newspaper!

My student Pablo Valle was recently interviewd by the Kitto newspaper. In his first accepted [paper](http://ebiltegia.mondragon.edu:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.11984/5256/Metamorphic%20Testing%20of%20Autonomous%20Vehicles%20a%20Case%20Study%20on%20Simulink.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), he presents a metamorphic testing approach to automatically test autonomous cars that are modeled in Simulink. The paper was published in the [Student Research Track of ICSE 2021](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-ACM-Student-Research-Competition#event-overview). Three Metamorphic Relation Input patterns are proposed, from which a total of six Metamorphic Relations are derived. For eight seeded bugs, all of them could be detected!

Personally, I believe this is the first of many papers that Pablo will get accepted in his career!
